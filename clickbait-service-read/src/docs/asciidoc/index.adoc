This documentation describes the the available endpoints of the ClickBait Read-Service API and how to interact
with them.

== Get the clickbait score of a social media post instance

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `POST /clickbait/score`

This endpoint requires a social media post encoded into a JSON object
with the structure shown below in the examples.

Example request with a minimal json input:
include::{snippets}/score-valid-post-minimal/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/score-valid-post-minimal/request-fields.adoc[]

HTTP response:
include::{snippets}/score-valid-post-minimal/http-response.adoc[]

The above example response returns an object containing the same ID and the determined clickbait score:
include::{snippets}/score-valid-post-minimal/response-fields.adoc[]

[WARNING]
Currently, only the English language is supported. The service performs
language detection and if the content is not in English, the endpoint
returns 400 BAD_REQUEST

Second example with more (optional) data provided:
include::{snippets}/score-valid-post-filled/http-request.adoc[]

Corresponding response:
include::{snippets}/score-valid-post-filled/http-response.adoc[]
