This documentation describes the the available endpoints of the ClickBait Content-Extraction-Service API and how to interact
with them.

== Extract content of a web page

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `GET /content?url={url}&title={title}`

This endpoint requires a `url` query parameter which specifies the target
web page either implicitly (redirect) or explicitly. The `title` is an optional parameter:

include::{snippets}/extract-wrapper/request-parameters.adoc[]

The endpoint supports streaming, therefore it may be called with the following
accept headers:

* application/json
* application/stream+json
* text/event-stream

In the first case, i.e. if the call is executed synchronously, the endpoint returns a so-called
`ContentWrapper` object. The result may look like as follows:
include::{snippets}/extract-wrapper/http-response.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/extract-wrapper/response-fields.adoc[]

[NOTE]
In any of the other two, asynchronous cases the result is essentially a flow/stream of
content objects, i.e. there is no `redirectUrl` or `sourceUrl` available in the response.
