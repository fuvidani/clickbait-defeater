# Redis High-Availability Docker Setup

This folder contains a high-availability setup for a Redis-cluster using Docker and 
Docker-Compose. Due to the problematic IP-management of slaves during runtime (caused 
by the nature of Docker), this feature is currently not used. However the configuration
files remain here for future use.
